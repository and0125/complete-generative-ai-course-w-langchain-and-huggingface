## what is a framework

a framework is a set of principles that enable you to reproduce a result more quickly.

A software framework is some basic functionality that can be used and extended to create applications with complex features.

Some frameworks are:

- angular, django react native, ASP .NET, react js, react native

## what is a large language model

These are models trained on massive levels of text data to learn patterns and entity relationships in the language. These can use a deep learning algorithm to process and understand natural langauge, performing tasks such as translating, analyzing sentiments, and generating new text.

It can summarize or generate new texts, classify data, and extract information from texts.

## What is langchain

langchain is an open-source framework that equips develoeprs with the necessary tools to create applications that are powered by LLMs.

This is like lego blocks for communicating to LLMs, and can use them to speed up the application development, to create pipelines from scratch, and can use pipelines to link multiple LLMs.

## Why do we need Langchain?

- most LLMs are not up to date; they have been trained with data up to a particular date, and past that, there is no recent data in these LLMs about current events.
- they are not good with domain specific knowledge and fail when working with proprietary data, because the propreitary data hasn't been used in training the model.
- working with different LLMs may become a tedious task; you may use a couple LLMs for different tasks.

Langchain has the following benefits:

- langchain enables you to link your data to other data sources, like file systems, databases, and APIs. As opposed to those that merely reach out to an LLM via API, its enables the ability to create apps that are more robust and creative.
- agentic: langchain enables you to create agents that employ LLMs and decide what to do and how to do it. This enables applications to create applications that can communicate more effectively with an environment.
- Chains: ability to handle different tasks and other unitilites using langchain. This enables the development of more advanced projects that are capable of handling many different tasks.
